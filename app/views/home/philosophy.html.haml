          %h3 we're all about connecting you with the small businesses that feed you
 
          %p Running a restaurant, bar, or cafe isn't easy. The small business owners that create awesome food and experiences for us are passionate, hard-working, and <em> often anonymous</em>.
          %p We at Simmr want to shine a light on them. We want to help you build a relationship with the places where you eat - to become more than a customer and be a part of the "family" of the small businesses that you love.
          %p We do this by helping businesses put on exciting experiences. We make sure these experiences are <em> small </em> enough that you get to interact personally with the people behind the business and <em> unique </em> enough that it doesn't feel like a normal visit. We believe that upon forming a real relationship with these people, you are much more likely to revisit and help spread the word -- both things that business owners really depend on to thrive. 
          %p In exchange, we work with business owners to make sure your support is rewarded with further involvement, personal touches, and unique experiences.
          %p
